# smitheryai-mcp-servers-github
- github folder from https://github.com/smithery-ai/mcp-servers
- cloned copy at: https://github.com/geobio/smitheryai-mcp-servers

this is the code that's running at https://smithery.ai/server/@smithery-ai/github

it's not the latest mcp server because there's 2 others:
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/server-github (this is deprecated)
- https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server (written in go)
- but i wanted the old version to be compatible with some existing MCP tasks that I want to replay
